This page explains how to install Krux from source. You can check a simplified version of these instructions in our [README](https://github.com/selfcustody/krux) too.

### Fetch the code
This will download the source code of Krux as well as the code of all its dependencies inside a new folder called `krux` (needs [`git`](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)):
```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/selfcustody/krux
```

**Note**: When you wish to pull updates (to all submodules, their submodules, ...) to this repo, use:
```bash
git pull origin main && git submodule update --init --recursive
```

#### Prerequisite for upgrading via microSD
If you wish to perform airgapped upgrades via microSD card later, you will need to have a private and public key pair to sign your builds and verify the signatures. If you do not want to perform further airgapped upgrades, jump to [build section](#build-the-firmware-linux-or-wsl).

You can use an existing Krux installation and mnemonic to sign your builds with, **or** you can generate a keypair and sign from the [`openssl` CLI](https://wiki.openssl.org/index.php/Command_Line_Elliptic_Curve_Operations). Commands have been added to the `krux` shell script to make this easier.

In either case, you will need to update the `SIGNER_PUBKEY` field in `src/krux/metadata.py` to store your public key so that Krux can verify future builds before installing.

To generate a keypair:
```bash
./krux generate-keypair
./krux pem-to-pubkey pubkey.pem
```

The first command will create `privkey.pem` and `pubkey.pem` files you can use with openssl, and the second command will output your public key in the form expected by Krux.

Once you've updated the `SIGNER_PUBKEY` with this value, you can proceed with the regular build process.

### Build the firmware (Linux or WSL)
The [krux bash script](https://github.com/selfcustody/krux/blob/main/krux) contains commands for common development tasks. It assumes a Linux host, you will need to have [Docker Desktop or Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/), `openssl`, and `wget` installed at a minimum for the commands to work as expected. It works on Windows using WSL. The channel Crypto Guide from Youtube made a step-by-step video - [Krux DIY Bitcoin Signer: Build From Source & Verify (With Windows + WSL2 + Docker)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmr_TFy2TfQ)

To build and flash the firmware:
```bash
# build firmware for Maix Amigo
./krux build maixpy_amigo
```

The first time, the build can take around an hour or so to complete. Subsequent builds should take only a few minutes. If all goes well, you should see a new `build` folder containing `firmware.bin` and `kboot.kfpkg` files when the build completes.

**Note**: if you encounter any of these errors while building, it is a problem connecting to github, try again (if the error persists, try changing the DNS/VPN or correcting the hostname resolution of github.com to an IP that is working for you):
```
error: RPC failed; curl 92 HTTP/2 stream 0 was not closed cleanly: CANCEL (err8)
fatal: the remote end hung up unexpectedly
fatal: early EOF
fatal: index-pack failed
fatal: clone of ... failed
Failed to clone ...
```

#### Reproducibility
If you build from the `main` branch of the source code, you should be able to reproduce the build process used to generate the latest release binaries and obtain exactly the same copies of the `firmware.bin` and `kboot.kfpkg` files, with matching hash checksums (to check for an older version, use the `tag` instead).

To check, use the compiled files for the target device. Each command should output the same hash for the two provided files:
```bash
sha256sum build/firmware.bin {{latest_krux}}/maixpy_DEVICE/firmware.bin
sha256sum build/kboot.kfpkg {{latest_krux}}/maixpy_DEVICE/kboot.kfpkg
```

If you want to extract and verify the `firmware.bin`file contained in `kboot.kfpkg`, use the following:

```bash
unzip kboot.kfpkg -d ./kboot/
```

### Flash the firmware onto the device
Connect the device to your computer via USB (for Maix Amigo, make sure youâ€™re using bottom port), power it on, and run the following, replacing `DEVICE` with either `m5stickv`, `amigo`, `bit`, `cube`, `dock`, `yahboom` or `wonder_mv`:
```bash
# flash firmware to DEVICE
./krux flash maixpy_DEVICE
```
If flashing fails try reading [Troubleshooting](../../troubleshooting.md)

### Signing the firmware
You can sign the firmware to [perform airgapped upgrades](#prerequisite-for-upgrading-via-microsd) using one of the two methods listed below:

#### Method 1: Signing from Krux
First, calculate the SHA256 hash of the new firmware by running:
```bash
./krux sha256 build/firmware.bin
```

Copy this hex string and turn it into a QR code using whichever QR code generator you'd like.

In Krux, enter the mnemonic of your private key that will be used for signing, and go to **Sign -> Message**. Scan the QR code you generated, and you will be asked if you wish to sign the hash. Proceed, and you will be presented with a base64-encoded string containing the signature, as text and as a QR code.

Take this string and create a signature file by running:
```bash
./krux b64decode "signature-in-base64" > build/firmware.bin.sig
```

This will generate a `firmware.bin.sig` file containing a signature of the firmware's SHA256 hash.

#### Method 2: Signing from your computer with OpenSSL
With the keypair [you generated before](#prerequisite-for-upgrading-via-microsd), you can now run:
```bash
./krux sign build/firmware.bin privkey.pem
```

This will generate a `firmware.bin.sig` file containing a signature of the firmware's SHA256 hash.
